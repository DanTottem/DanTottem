# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Daniel**, a Backend Developer based in Brazil.

I enjoy solving problems, optimizing time, and automating everything I can.

If a task can be automated or a process can be faster, chances are I'll build a script for it.

My main tech stack is **Python, Java, and MySQL**. My favorite tools are **VS Code** and I'm currently (bravely) trying to learn **Aseprite** — though I'm still terrible at pixel art. 🎨

I haven't moved my main projects to GitHub yet, but I'm currently writing a **Science Fiction book** (work in progress! 🚀).

**Fun Facts:**

* 🐱 I love cats, but I haven't had the courage to adopt one yet.
* ☕ I actually hate coffee (yes, we exist).
* 🎮 Passionate about games since I was 4 years old.
* ✍️ Amateur Sci-Fi writer.
